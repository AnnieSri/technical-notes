# Item 34
- Use enums instead of int constants
- When we have an enumerated type whose values are a fixed set of constants we should use `enum`. Bad alternatives are constant strings or ints like this:

```Java
// bad
public static final int APPLE_FUJI = 0;
public static final int APPLE_PIPPIN = 1;

public static final int ORANGE_NAVEL = 0;
public static final int ORANGE_BLOOD = 1;
```

instead we can use something like this:

```Java
public enum Apple { FUJI, PIPPIN, GRANNY_SMITH }
public enum Orange { NAVEL, BLOOD, TEMPLE }
```
- this item also talks about various disadvantages of using constant ints or strings. For example in above example int values are used for both orange and apple types, later we can do math operations with these ints or can potentially compare these ints which is mathematically allowed but we are basically comparing apples to oranges! They are also verbose (long prefixes before each constant â€”`APPLE_`)
- enums are designed for this and other than simple example above (which is what we need most of the times) we can make them more advanced with extra functionalities:
```Java
public enum Planet {
    MERCURY(3.302e+23, 2.439e5),
    VENUS(4.859e+24, 6.052e6),
    EARTH(5.975e+24, 6.378e6),
    ...;

    private final double mass;
    private final double radius;
    private final double surfaceGravity;

    // constructor
    Planet(double mass, double radius) {
        this.mass = mass;
        this.radius = radius;
        surfaceGravity = 6.6e-11 * mass / (radius*radius);
    }

    public double mass() {return mass;}
    public double radius() {return radius;}
    public double surfaceGravity() {return surfaceGravity;}

    public double surfaceWeight(double mass) {
        return mass * surfaceGravity;
    }
}
```
- in the above code sample we are associating data with enum constants (mass, radius,..) and to do that we should add a constructor. we've also added a shared functionality to easily calculate the surface weight for each constant. Look at these sample usages of the above enum:
```Java
double earthWeight = 158; // or read from input
double mass = earthWeight / Planet.EARTH.surfaceGravity();
```
or
```Java
for (Planet planet : Planet.values()) {
    System.out.println("Weight on " + planet + " is " + planet.surfaceWeight(mass));
}
```
- note that all enums have static `values()` that returns an array of their values. they also have a default `toString()` which returns the declared name of each enum value. We can override this if we want.
- If enums are only needed in a class we should define them as a member class of that class, but if they are helpful in other places we should declare them as a top-level class.
- in `Planet` enum example we had a shared functionality (`surfaceWeight()`) that was similar for all of its constants. If we want a method that behaves different for each constant, best approach is to define an abstract method and implement it like this:
```Java
public enum Operation {
    PLUS("+") {public double apply(double x, double y){return x + y;} },
    MINUS("-") {public double apply(double x, double y){return x - y;} },
    TIMES("*") {public double apply(double x, double y){return x * y;} },
    DIVIDE("/") {public double apply(double x, double y){return x / y;} };

    public abstract double apply(double x, double y);

    public final String symbol;

    Operation(String symbol) {
        this.symbol = symbol;
    }
}
```
