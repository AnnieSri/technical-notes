# Tips

## Paragraphs and Line Breaks
- To make paragraphs, just do double enters. But if you wanna force a new line, at the end of the line *type two spaces and then enter*  

## Emphasis and Bolding
### Italics
This *works* and this _works_ too. (asterisks are preferred by GitHub editor).
### Bolding
This **works** and this __works__ too.
To make it bold and italicized, do ***this*** or ___this___.
### Strikethrough
You can do it like ~~this~~

## Blockquotes
> Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as possible.
>
> Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it's been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.  â€” *John Gruber*

## Horizontal Rule
- like this:
---
- or this:
___
- or this:
***
